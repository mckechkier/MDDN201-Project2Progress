		<h1>Duckboy</h1>
		<h4><em> By Kiera McKechnie </em></h4>

<section id = Initial-Idea>
		<h5><em> Everyday women are fooled and mistreated by males/duckboys that use and lead them on. While these various characteristics, traits and techniques can be identified and prevented quite easily, women still fall for these lies and manipulations, and end up getting hurt in the process. duckboy aims to put a stop to this, and allow women to invest their ener- gy and time into the men who truly deserve them and will treat them right! </em> </h5>

<h5> <em> The founder of Duckboy was sick of sitting by and watching her friends and fellow
women consistently get used and abused by immature men who only wanted one thing. She dreamed of a world where all women would see the red flags and actually believe them, and in return live their best lives. </em> </h5>

<h5> <em>Duckboy is both a downloadable application, and website that women can download for free! The application has two main features, firstly an internal generator. Women are able to put in characteristics, things a certain male has said to them, actions, personality traits, and any other details about the male; for example, style and haircut. The generator will then reveal whether that man is a Duckboy or not. </em></h5>

           <h2> Progress 1 ; Planning & Deciding where to start </h2>
	<p><em> 
With progressing from Project 1 to Project 2, I felt a little stuck with how to to actually go from my proposal to building a platform, women could actually use, communicate through, learn from & discover whether the man they're speaking to/seeing is a 'fuckboy' or not!

I started doing a bit of research and watched some tutorials that might've been able to point me in the right direction on how to get started. Ones about creating random password generators, a series on creating a social media app, etc etc. My biggest barrier was that of course I had made simple and definitely presentable websites before, and have played and learnt with javascript in Creative Coding papers. But my websites had never gone further than just reading and looking at what was on the page. I wanted this to be <strong> interactive and usable!</strong> The part I really wanted to create was the Generator section. This was the main 'hook' and purpose of Duckboy. But I had no clue on where to even begin. The generator I had in mind was one that took the information given to it and produced a 'result'/gave an answer, It wasn't <strong>random</strong>.

			<h2> Progress 2 ; Wit.AI learning </h2>
<p><em> I went and spoke to lecturer Walter Langelaar about my idea for some guidance, feedback and help. He mentioned about previous students using a platform called Wit.AI to create 'chatbots' where you can ask them something, or talk to them and they will respond and give an answer to the question. A bit similar to my Generator idea, where I wanted women to be able to input information about the boy they're speaking to or seeing to find out if he is a fuckboy. Creating/using a 'chatbot' was a bit different and at first it felt it strayed a bit from my initial idea, but it intrigued me and felt like an interesting progression. The 'chatbot' would be basically have same function and purpose of the Generator, but would be much more 'doable' in terms of a two and a half week project! 

I spent a couple days watching some Wit.AI tutorials, playing around on the site, and beginning to learn how to create a 'chatbot' myself! I begun by creating a practise app on Wit.AI, beginning to teach the 'chatbot' phrases women would say, things they would ask, and the different variables used and what they meant. </em></p>

<p><em> There were a few parts, the first being <strong>'intent'</strong>, what the women who message would actually be wanting from their question/message. This was to find out 'Is the boy a fuckboy'. </em></p>

<p><em> The second part was creating <strong>'entities'</strong> which are the details that make up the message sent to the 'chatbot'. The 'frequency' of a detail about a boy; this could be how often he talks to them. If the detail about the boy is 'negative'; say he doesn't want to be seen in public with the girl, that 'doesn't' makes the message a negative. Another interesting one I thought of was 'rare_timing', basically if the message explains that the boy only messages or sees the particular girl at rare times. 

The entities are all just trying to give more information to the 'chatbot', and point out important details that would tip off the 'chatbot' to knowing the male is a fuckboy.</em> </p>

<p><em> And the last part was <strong>utterances</strong>, key phrases or messages girls may say/message to the 'chatbot' that indicate the male is in fact a fuckboy. The idea is the over time the 'chatbot' learns and takes in this information so you know longer have to teach it every time a girl was to send a message in. 

At this point I was getting really intrigued and interested to see where I could take the idea!</em> </p>

			<h2> Progress 3 ; Wit.AI & Facebook connection unfeasible </h2>
	<p><em> After a couple hours of me retrying & researching , Facebook would not allow me to connect my Wit.AI 'app' to a 'Facebook app', as I could not prove that I was in fact a 'business' or had a real 'application' to connect with Facebook Developers. The tutorials I had been watching and research about chatbots had all come from 2016, 2015 & 2014, and unfortunately Facebook had updated their Facebook Developers section and policies immensely so that only real businesses could create apps and use Developers section. (Which I mean was probably a good thing in the grand scheme of things but not great for my project). </em></p>

     <p><em> I was able to bypass a part of Facebook's new'review' section, by entering a fake privacy policy, these are now required for all platforms on Facebook so that users can see what data of theirs you are collecting and how you will use the data. (Even though I was not actually collecting data, it requires all apps through the site to have a privacy policy). I found a 'Free Privacy Policy' website and thought I had bet the system.</em></p>

	<p><em> But Facebook would not let me proceed any further as it required business identification; uploading 'an official document showing my business or organization's name and physical address'. I tried changing the app type to not be a direct business, but it still asked for the same information. This was only a more recent update, and was not present during all the tutorials and research I found around Wit.AI. I felt back at stage one again, not really sure what I was going to do. I looked at a couple other resources for creating a chatbot with a similar effect but they are all made to connect with Facebook. </em></p>

			<h2>Progress 4 ; Building new prototype</h2>
	<p><em>I stumbled across a new prototype idea while rewatching some of the tutorials I had looked at first, one specifically about coding a math quiz for kids to use. I thought I could use a similar concept and method but change and tailor the code to suit a different type of quiz for 'Duckboy'. In the quiz having a set of questions women answer about the guy they're seeing and the quiz tells them whether he is a 'fuckboy or not', using red for 'red flag'/fuckboy, and green for 'all clear'/not a fuckboy. I used a combination of HTML, CSS & JS to create the basic quiz with a couple questions to start me off.</em> </p>

	<p> <em> 

I actually really liked this idea, and was relieved to have got it semi functioning. I was also really happy that it <strong> worked. </strong> It was not just a prototype made from Adobe XD or another site similar. I remebered Walter mentioning in the lecture how they kind of tricked people into thinking they were a real product when they weren't, they just sort of mimicked a functioning product. I was so proud to have an actual 'quiz' that you could physically play. I spent quite a few days figuring out and getting down the Javascript code, and making sure it all worked well.  </em> </p>

			<h2> Progress 5 ; Getting the aesthetics </h2>
<p><em>I worked on getting the aesthetic features of the quiz to make it really the 'Duckboy' style. </em></p>

<p> <em> I really loved how it looked, it was bold, yet simplistic. I still had lots to figure out, was not too sure how many questions to have in the quiz, and what other features I could add to the overall website to make it more appealing and attractive. Honestly I was just so glad I hadn't <strong> messed up the JS,</strong> as I had been very prone to making silly mistakes with prior projects using JS in Creative Coding.</em></p>

			<h2>Progress 6 ; Creating a mock website to track progress</h2>
			<p><em> At this point I had spent so much <strong> constant </strong> time on the website, just even looking at it, refreshing the page, messing around with colours etc, so I wanted to have a little break so I could go back to it with fresh eyes. </em><p>

			<p><em>I begun creating <strong>this!</strong> A website to track my progress in an alternative way to the journal, and as per the brief. I wanted this to be a bit of a 'past', 'look back on' approach rather than it being updates on that day in the present tense like my journal entries were. These were looking back on a prior day, or at the end to summarize that point in time in the assignment. I made the basic website outlook and just copied and pastied my journal entires in place, to then in future go back and read, reflect and rewrite them from a different angle. </em></p>

			<h2>Progress 7 ; Mid Point!</h2>
			<p><em> At this point I had finished those fundamental features of the website, and was working to try out and add some new techniques and effects to really elvate the design and website as a whole.</em><p>

			<p><em>I added a couples features that really made my website feel 'put together' and like a real website a girl would use. These being a little tips section, and a forum girls can use to send in their own tips to be added to the website. These social media elements felt important to add as they were a big part of my inital proposal, and although I couldn't truly bring in all the different sections I had invisioned in full, it felt like I was still delivering a part of that.  </em></p>

			<h2>Progress 8 ; Refining & finishing up</h2>
			<p><em> i had recieved some feedback from the lecturer Walter on my website so far. The one piece of advice he gave me was that a couple of the questions in the quiz needed to be simplified slightly just because they were a bit confusing. After looking back on the questions I did find that a couple could be taken/sound differently than I intended them to sound so have made sure all my questions were simple and understandable to anyone. I then checked with a couple of my friends who I'd see as my 'target audience' and they gave the all clear!</em><p>

			<p><em> The refinement stage was really fun. I perfected all the little details and elements on the website. And added a little user rating tab at the bottom to show an overview of the 'reviews' that had been done on the quiz. Alongside, an average rating of 4.1 stars, and a 85% success rate for finding out if a boy is a 'fuckboy'. This was just to add a little character to the website and that <strong>trustworthy and reliable</strong> element that would be important for new users in an actual application or website. </em></p>

			<p><em> An effect I created in my refinement stage that I really love is the glowing effect I added to the bottom text. The glow really just brings all those feminine elements all together and elevates the text. I also ended up adding it to a couple other headings on the page, just to bring that cohesiveness through. A cohesive and consistent design was really important to me. If not, It would just look a bit random all of a sudden at the bottom of the page, having a new and completely different effect on the text. The glow flickers slightly which you would have seen in my presentation video. The flickering glow brings that interactive and satisfying look to engage the viewer's eyes. </em></p>

			<h1>Final</h1>
			<p><em> My final quiz website prototype is honestly even better than I expected! It's completely different from my initial vision for this project but I'm really pleased with how it's turned out. It's ticks all my boxes in terms of being a physical, usable 'product'/application, it has that 'iconic', feminine, visual style progressed from project 1, and has little bits of each 'part' from my initial proposal - the 'Generator' and those social media elements. There were a few struggles along the way with getting started and getting that properly functioning quiz down, but towards the end I was just met with pretty smooth sailing and got to try out and use new techniques I hadn't tried before.<strong> This really is the first big project I've done where I've collaborated learnings from different papers within the Media Design faculty. </strong> I definitely developed my understanding and ability with javascript through creating the quiz, this I was introduced to in my previous Creative Coding papers. I feel like I can actually read and understand code and javascript, and am beginning to become more confident in forming functions myself. I was 'umming' and 'ahhh' for a day or so about the background of the website, whether it was too simple being just a nice gradient, and whether it needed more background noise, little details or something else. But I have come to the conclusion that there really is enough on the website. I feel like adding little details to the background, some sort of images or something, wouldn't really bring anything <strong>valuable.</strong> It would just be distracting and potentially too busy. I looked at other quiz websites, and social websites and found that less was more. I'm happy with the balance of elements on the page, and that each of them have a purpose and bring meaning and depth to the website. </em></p>
